# Island Fox Simulations
### Scripts for simulations used in "Purging of strongly deleterious mutations explains long-term persistence and absence of inbreeding depression in island foxes" by Robinson et al. (2018).

* `SimCoalescent_SanNicolasPeaks_msprime` contains scripts and files to run coalescent simulations under putative models of San Nicolas island fox demographic history in msprime (Kelleher et al., 2016).

* `SimForward_IslandMainlandVariation_SLiM` contains scripts to run forward simulations of neutral and deleterious variation in island and mainland populations in SLiM (Haller and Messer, 2016).
